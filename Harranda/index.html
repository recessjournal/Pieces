<div class="story story1"><p>
Eight miles from the Syrian border riding in a dolmu&#351; with five teenage rebels
unwashed and pimply, having spent Kurban Bayram calling on their parents in the
refugee camp outside of Antep, itching to cross back to Aleppo &mdash; and a woman in
a niqab clutching a baby so pale, so pockmarked, so limp, its tiny limbs cracked and
blistered by the Anatolian sun &mdash; and I&rsquo;ve seen dead-looking babies before
but this one takes the cake &mdash; is it dead, please let it not be dead, please
&mdash; three hours in the baby wakes up bawling, and I&rsquo;ve never prayed for a
baby to start crying before, but oh thank god &mdash; the bus stops in the middle of a
deserted highway, and the kids run off into a field of cotton, taking the shortest
route back to the border. They&rsquo;re carrying laundry in plastic grocery bags,
knives, and baklava for their brothers, singing Bollywood songs, bragging about the
firefights they&rsquo;ve been in. Ahmed, the high-and-tight with a little English,
told us he&rsquo;s killed someone. But they all seem to be named Ahmed and from the
back, just their torsos rising above the cotton, I can&rsquo;t tell them apart &mdash;
except for one with a rust red stain on the back of his white, white polo
shirt.</p></div><div class="story story2"><p> I think this is from the sacrifice:
three days ago &mdash; thankfully, it was not too warm &mdash; the gutters ran red,
full of the blood from the skinned carcasses of cows, sheep and goats lying in their
own offal in front yards and fields across the country &mdash; the air pink and
buttery &mdash; and within me awoke a feral urge to restrain between my thighs a
writhing, bleating lamb, feeling its jackrabbit pulse beneath my left hand as I cup
its chin and raise its head to stare me straight in the eyes, the knife in my right
hand &mdash; then its life gushing forth, warm and persistent, against my coveralls.
From two miles away, the half-wild dogs smell the blood and start running into town,
but the flies get there first. Is this what they call bloodlust? </p> </div> <div
class="illus illus1"></div> <div class="story story3"> <span class="emaside">Is this
what they call bloodlust?</span>

<p> So I telephone my resident expert on bloodlust, to tell him how every night this
week I have walked into a hotel in the Pamirs &mdash; through the lobby where there is
a piano carried key by key from Moscow on the back of the Red Army &mdash; to find him
bleeding out upstairs in a bathtub from two long, thin gashes in his wrists. Yes, he
says. I&rsquo;ve been having that dream for years &mdash; since an Afghan shot someone
he loved, and he shot the Afghan, and then he shot many more Afghans besides. He
thinks their souls are out there, wandering in the wasteland, looking for him, for a
corpse with his dog tags. </p> </div> <div class="story story4"> <p> He is drunk. It
is not a productive conversation.</p> <p>Before I hang up he says, Don&rsquo;t worry
about me &mdash; I&rsquo;m getting better &mdash; it&rsquo;s my own jihad &mdash;and
that makes me smile because I remember myself at age twelve, unwashed and pimply,
yelling at the television, so frustrated that no one could understand how jihad was
almost never &mdash; never, ever &mdash; about blowing up Americans &mdash; frustrated
in the way that children get frustrated, because it is you against the world and no
one believes anything you say &mdash; so I smile. </p> </div> <div class="story
story5">

<p>I am still smiling the next day when I pass a truck named Elanur on a densely
forested mountain highway. On the dash is installed a stuffed cat I imagine the driver
won at a carnival &mdash; powder blue with a pink satin bow strangling its neck. On
second thought, I decide, the plastic sunglasses sewn to the bridge of the cat&rsquo;s
nose are a nice touch. Perhaps it makes the driver feel less alone, as if there is the
possibility that behind those mock lenses a pair of eyes watch the road with him. Then
&mdash; before I can think &mdash; in front of me is one of the dams, one of the many
dams that throttle the southeast, and the spires of minarets cresting the top of the
water where once there were villages are like hands reaching above the waves, reaching
for help. And everywhere &mdash; I imagine I can even catch a whiff on the top of the
dam &mdash; is still the dank smell of raw beef, sour on the roof of my mouth, even if
the remains themselves are gone, spirited away to stewpots, to relatives, to the
needy.</p> </div>

 <div class="story story6"> <span class="emaside">And everywhere is still the dank
smell of raw beef.</span> <p>A macabre thought: what did my grandfather smell as he
walked through the wreckage of the Beirut barracks among the concrete and barbed wire
where the bodies &mdash; the parts of bodies &mdash; of Marines had lain until someone
thought to remove them days before his visit. The loose ends of his war, so cold and
collected. A war fought from the confines of metal capsules slicing through the deep
&mdash; erupting before him, then, in a spray of passion, cunning and disillusionment,
as it had so often before.</p></div>

 <div class="story story7"><p> This is what draws me to the Middle East &mdash; what
drew my family to the Middle East &mdash; it is the passion of people who are willing
not just to stand up for what they believe in but also to fight for it, of people who
reject cynicism and acknowledge that adolescent frustration sometimes never goes away,
of people who polish the thin edge between life and death until it&rsquo;s almost
invisible.</p> <p>And there are people like this everywhere. But I never met them
until I got here. </p></div>
