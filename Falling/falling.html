Every spring in the Solapur village in western India, babies are dropped off of the top of a 50-foot temple tower.
 This ritual has been practiced for centuries. In the winter, a committee of elders selects five male newborns. From then on, these chosen infants occupy a conspicuously distinguished place in village society: they wear special white robes, their hands and feet are laced with intricate henna, they eat only the ripest mangoes. This is all to prepare for a weeklong religious festival that occurs in April. On the morning of the final day of the festival, a parade of villagers travels to each baby&#39;s house to collect him. There is joyful singing and dancing, the dusty earth rising up in a cloud that half-conceals the twirling bodies until they appear as one gritty, gyrating mass. The procession winds its way to the center of a square where the temple stands. In the shadow of the tower they stop, hushed. Only the elders, cradling the babies, are permitted to enter and climb the narrow stairs to the top of the temple. On the ground, a couple villagers unfurl a large white tarp and hold it taut between them. The elders reach the rooftop, and one steps forward to the ledge, a baby clutched between his hands. He hoists the white bundle over his shoulders, arms fully extended now, thrusting the child into the warm spring air, up, up. The baby is screaming, gurgling hiccupy yelps that echo over the dense quiet below. The elder holds the infant there for a breath.

	<p>
Then he lets go. He doesn&#39;t fling, or heave, or hurl -- he simply releases. For a second, the small body seems suspended in the air right blow the elders&#39; splayed fingers. But then it picks up speed, fast, faster. The baby is silent. Plunging. Gravity pulls and accelerates a tiny white comet, a glimmering speck of dust, a snowflake. White robes strikes white tarp with a whoosh, the tiny form bouncing on impact, rebounding, then settling. The infant begins to cry softly. The parents pick up their child from the tarp. They are sniffling and smiling and praying. According to Muslim tradition, the baby and his family are now blessed with good health and good fortune for the rest of the year.

Recently, several news Western news sources found out about this ritual and lambasted Indian authorities for allowing such a &#34;cruel and sadistic practice&#34; to occur. Human rights groups got involved, protesting the &#34;Indian baby throwing.&#34; A village spokesperson expressed confusion in an interview. &#34;We are not throwing babies,&#34; he said. &#34;They are falling.&#34;

There are names, just names. Engraved on black marble polished so shiny you see your face in it when you look close enough. You run your hands over the grooves of letters carved in the surface, your fingertips graze smooth blankness and neat incision. On a plaque it says that all of the work was done by hand. You wonder whose job this was. You wonder whether the names still meant anything to this mystery artist after his thousandth etching, or whether he put chisel to stone mindlessly as letters followed letters in a senseless string. Your dad says that the whole point is the repetition, that&#39;s how it makes an impact. Brilliant, he says. You nod. But truthfully you find it all wrong. It isn&#39;t raw enough. Heroes hampered in rigid columns, sacrifice smothered in perfect rows. Uniforms worn in life beget uniformity in death, it seems.

You&#39;re on the M&#39;s now. Benjamin Mikowsky, Dwayne Milton, Phillip Miller. You lay your cheek against the dark fa&#199ade and it feels unexpectedly cold for August. Someone put a heart-shaped wreath on the ground but you don&#39;t know which soldier it was meant for. Or maybe it wasn&#39;t meant for one single person, there&#39;s no way to tell. The silence is eerie and you don&#39;t like seeing your face reflected behind the names anymore. It looks like you&#39;re trapped behind their memory, but the memory doesn&#39;t feel right, because all of the M&#39;s are shaped the same. No one you know writes all of their M&#39;s identically, there&#39;s always slight variation. Why are all of the M&#39;s shaped the same? You want to leave the Vietnam Memorial. You just want a drink of water. You bump into a tourist as you try to get out of the crowd, and he is wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the words, &#34;Forever we honor the fallen.&#34;

In the first grade, I found out that leaves change color in the fall because fewer hours of sunlight curtail the photosynthesis process, which in turn decreases the production of green chlorophyll pigment, revealing the underlying colors of the leaves. The reds and oranges and golds visible in autumn are actually the leaves&#39; true hues, the chlorophyll just masks their brilliance for most of the year. This revelation both stunned me and made me miserable. Tears spilled down my cheeks in Mrs. Schaefer&#39;s science class. (It took Tyler Gates projectile vomiting in the lunch room for my classmates to forget this incident.)</p>
<p>
My six-year-old self mourned the loss of romance. There was something incredibly poetic in the colors of fall pulsating with energy on dying branches, fighting the encroaching frost with flush and fire. As days grew shorter and night selfishly shrouded once-bright hours in monotone grey, the vivid leaves pulsed memories of warmer months through spidery veins. Theirs was a valiant fight, but futile. Winter would inevitably come. And the leaves would shrivel and shed and die a noble death on the frozen ground. Poeticism aside, the changes of fall also appealed to me on a personal level -- I liked to think of the leaves as defiant, their blooming hues raising a symbolic middle finger to the audacious cold front. I self-aggrandizingly saw my personality reflected in autumn: I fancied myself spunky, outspoken, and so were the changing leaves. They understood me. 
</p><p>
But the scientific facts destroyed these conceptions, poetic and personal. The leaves were not actively protesting winter, but languishing helplessly as their healthy green was drained and their sickly autumnal shades were revealed. The yellows and crimsons I saw weren&#39;t heroic battle scars earned in the war against winter -- they were festering sores, a sign of decay. Fall wasn&#39;t a triumph, but a casualty.</p>
<p>
Only now, more than a decade after I cried in Mrs. Schaefer's class, am I beginning to see the beauty in the fact that the leaves#39; hues were there all along. Colors not obscured but laying in wait, unveiling themselves in the waning sunlight of fall. </p>

This is how my six-year-old self (circa the crying incident in Mrs. Schaefer&#39;s class) told the story of Adam and Eve: 
Adam and Eve are living in a paradise called the Garden of Eden. I am not sure where on Earth Eden is located, or how big it is, or who waters it. But there are a lot of very nice plants and animals. Adam and Eve keep the animals as pets but also eat them for food (my Sunday school teacher says this is normal, but I should under no circumstances try it with my dog at home). Also Adam and Eve are naked all the time, which sounds cold. They are the first humans ever so they have full control over the Garden: this is due to the fact that finders are keepers and losers are weepers, probably. 
God is there too because he is always there. He is the one who made the garden in the first place. God tells Adam and Eve that they can eat anything in the garden except for an apple from the Tree of Knowledge. Adam and Eve agree, saying, &#34;Of course God, we promise won&#39;t eat the apple! Besides, we have more dinner options here in Eden than they have in the Cheesecake Factory,&#34; or something like that. But there is this one really mean animal called the Serpent who is trying to trick them. The Serpent is the Devil in disguise and he is like a snake except he actually has four legs, which is weird. One day the Serpent walks over to Eve and says, &#34;Hey Eve, you should eat an apple and then you&#39;ll become a genius. God told you not to eat it because he doesn&#39;t want you to become more of a smarty-pants than he is, or something like that. This is a lie, but it makes sense to Eve. So she goes over to the Tree of Knowledge and picks an apple and takes a juicy bite. She also convinces Adam to take a bite because she is very persuasive (my Sunday school teacher says most women are). 
And then everything goes wrong. Adam and Eve realize they&#39;ve been naked this whole time and they&#39;re really embarrassed and probably cold, like I said before (my Sunday school teacher says that I am missing the point). They try to hide from God, but that doesn&#39;t work because God is everywhere. So God finds out and is disappointed and tells them that they have to leave Eden forever. The Serpent loses his legs as punishment, so now he has to slither on his belly for the rest of his life, which actually sounds kind of fun. Adam and Eve feel very bad because this is the first sin humans ever committed. My Sunday School teacher calls it the Fall.</p>

George remembers when he first met Jean at the A&W drive-through in the Dormont neighborhood of Pittsburgh during the summer of 1951. George remembers that that August was extremely muggy, so hot that the sidewalk steamed like a burner left on simmer, so hot that your forehead forgot what it felt like to remove its permanent crown of perspiration, so hot that the ice cream at the A&W was practically melted by the time it was delivered to your car. George remembers waiting for a cone in his stalling convertible in the A&W parking lot, he remembers prying his sticky thighs off scorching leather seats while the radio crooned listlessly in the background. George remembers looking out of his window and seeing a beautiful red-headed girl in an A&W uniform ambling towards him, clutching a dripping vanilla soft-serve. George remembers seeing her pause and look slyly around her. George remembers realizing that she didn&#39;t know anyone was watching, he remembers her sticking her tongue out and taking a giant lick of that icy swirl. George remembers the girl then approaching his car and handing him the cone, smiling, unaware of her newly acquired white moustache. George remembers writing his phone number on the corner of a dollar bill and handing it to her and telling her to keep the change. George remembers knowing he loved here right then and there. George remembers falling.</p>
